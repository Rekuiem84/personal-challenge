<h2 align="center"> Personal challenge to improve my understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript<h2>

## ðŸ”– About this

This is a personal challenge to replicate small HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects I've seen on various social media that
I thought were cool or seemed interesting to do by myself.

<br>

## ðŸŽ¯ The goal

To learn how to do things that I had no idea how they were made before trying to replicate them by myself.
  
Being proud of how a project looks after finishing it and not needing to think about how to perfect it afterwards.

## ðŸ“š The projects

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Project</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>See the repo</th>
      <th>See the demo</th>
      <th>See the original</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody align="center">
    <tr>
      <td>01</td>
      <td>Social Media Icons</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/Rekuiem84/social-media-icons/">Repo</a></td>
      <th><a href="https://rekuiem84.github.io/social-media-icons/">Demo</a></th>
